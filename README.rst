CECS
--------

This is my first attempt at creating a Python Module and is intended to assist with using the Cisco Enterprise Cloud Suite APIs. The initial work will be around UCS Director.

This have been inspired and influenced by https://github.com/hpreston/cisco_cloud. I initially intended to contribte to Hanks good work however as a learning exercise I wanted to create my own module and learn how to use unit testing for it.




To use (with caution), simply do::

    >>> import cecs
    >>> print cecs.joke()
